# Project Proposal: Adversarial Attacks in Segmentation (Pol Labarbarie, Adrien Chan-Hon-Tong)
-
## Implementation:

**Input :**

Use of approximately fifty MS-COCO images and pre-trained segmentation models from torchvision.


**Objectives :**

1. Successfully create any attack against one network (untargeted attack)
2. Successfully create an attack that leads to a specific prediction (targeted attack)
3. Evolution of performance with respect to the allowed norm of the attack
4. How does the attack behave on another network?
5. Same question if the attack is learned on a set of networks instead of just one.
