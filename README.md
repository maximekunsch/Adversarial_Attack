# Project Proposal: Adversarial Attacks in Segmentation (Pol Labarbarie, Adrien Chan-Hon-Tong)

## Implementation:

Input :

  Use of approximately fifty MS-COCO images
  Use of pre-trained segmentation models from torchvision


Objectives :

  Q1: Successfully create any attack against one network (untargeted attack)
  Q2: Successfully create an attack that leads to a specific prediction (targeted attack)
  Q3: Evolution of performance with respect to the allowed norm of the attack
  Q4: How does the attack behave on another network?
  Q5: Same question if the attack is learned on a set of networks instead of just one.
